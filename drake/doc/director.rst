Getting director
****************

As described in :ref:`Geometric Models in Drake <models>`, drake models can be
visualized in ``drake-visualizer`` application available from `director
<https://github.com/RobotLocomotion/director>`_. This document elaborates
different ways of obtaining director.

Choose an installation method
=============================

You can choose to download a pre-compiled version of director, or to build it
from source. The pre-compiled versions are much easier to use, but the source
version is easier to update and will make it easier to contribute any
fixes/improvements upstream.

Please note that director depends on `VTK <https://www.vtk.org`_. See :ref:`Installing VTK <get_vtk>`
for instructions of how to get VTK.
